# FriendFinder

####  FriendFinder is an app that finds a "make-believe friend" from our database (friends.js) and uses Node.js to do it.  This app compares the user's input of a series of 10 questions and finds the friend that matches best verses the other friends in the database.

### The user would get to the main page by typing in the following: 

    1.  'nodemon server.js'

    2.  The user will go to the local host and type 'localhost8080/' to get the main menu.  (see screenshot #1)

    3.  See you options on the main page.
        
### The Survey Page is found by either clicking on 'Go To Survey' or typing 'localhost8080/survey' in the address field:

    1.  Once the user is on the Survey Questions page, they must answer the questions provided.  (see screenshot #2)
    
    2.  Once the Submit button is pressed, the app will determine the closest choice for a best match and adds the 
    new User to the database.
	
    3.  Then, the app will display a modal (picture and name) of the best match for the user.  (see screenshot #3)

### Friends List Page is found by either clicking on the available links that are provided: "API Friends List or following step 1 below.  The last link available is the link to this GitHub Repo".  (see Screenshot #4)

    1.  The API Friends List page will list all friends from the available Friends List File (friends.js).  The 
    user will either go to the local host and type 'localhost8080/api/friends' to get the API Friends List or 
    click on the 'API Friends List' link located at the bottom of both the Main and Survey pages.
    (see Screenshot #5)
	
    2.  The GitHub Repository is also availabe at the bottom of both the Main and Survey pages by clicking on the 
    'GitHub Repo' link.
